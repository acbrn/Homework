    <h1 id="Main">Deadpool Best Comic Book Character</h1>
        <p class="Main" id="paragraph">
    The best comic book character is Deadpool. Below I will list out why the
    merc with the mouth, Mr. Wade Wilson is the absolute best character in any comic book
    series.
    </p>
    <ol class="orderlist" id="list1">
        <h2>Starting our list off strong here:</h2>
        <li>
            <p>
            Humor: Wade Wilson has very smart remarks for nearly all situations he is in.
            This is useful to help break the tension and the overly seriousness of the story.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            Cannot Die: Mr. Wilson, unlike his volleyball counterpart on the big screen movie, cannot die.
            With nearly every form of cancer in his body, his healing factor cures him as quickly as the cancer kills him.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            Lack of beliefs/morals: Deadpool does not have any moral guidelines he must adhere to.
            Deadpool has close friends and rules he follows but also changes to fit into the situation.
            Deadpool also changes his beliefs most of the time to whoever pays the best.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="unorderlist" id="list2">
        <h2>Deadpool's downfalls:</h2>
        <li>
            <p>
                A.
            </p>
            <li>
            <p>
                B.
            </p>
            <li>
            <p>
                C.
            </p>
            <li>
            <p>
                D. Oh, were you expecting something? Ha-ha, no, that doesn't happen here.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Added Note</h3>
        <p>
            Deadpool has had several mediums in which he has appeared. 
            Comics, movies, and even in songs, and in almost every case Deadpool is aware that he is a comic book character. He constantly breaks the "fourth wall", which is to talk directly to the audience.
